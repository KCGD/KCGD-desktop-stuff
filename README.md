# Welcome to my humble abode!

This is a code dump for some modifications i made to my desktop. Keep in mind THIS IS A CODE DUMP, it is for the most part an "as is" dump of what I have running. You will almose definatley need to edit it's code to fit your system.

By default it is designed to work on Arch Linux with systemd running GNOME 41.3.

## Installation

Make sure you have npm and nodejs installed on your system and accessible from the terminal

Arch and arch based:
```bash
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
```
Debian and Debian based:
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```
OpenSUSE
```bash
zypper install nodejs14
```


The setup script (setup.sh) will automatically download and extract nwjs, along with installing the required node modules.
